The first thing we do is that we go to the log files and see if we can find the error. Sadly the developer who wrote the code did not think that anything could go wrong so, so he decided not to spend the time creating a meaningful error message, after all, what could possibly go wrong?&mldr; So we end up with a generic error message which does not show the root course of the error.</p><p>Luckily it&rsquo;s not the first time that someone forgot to implemented logging, and as the skilled software developer we are, we go to the development environment and see if we can reproduce the error. After a long time spent, we give up and go to the production environment to check if the bug perhaps has magically disappeared. Hopefully, it is gone so we can tell the customer how hard the bug was to track down and how we manipulated single bits to make everything work again! Sadly the bug is still there&mldr;</p><p>Since we cannot reproduce the error in the development environment we now have two choices. The first choice is to implement more logging, but this requires us to restart the production server to get everything up and running again, and the customer does not like that idea.</p><p>The second choice is to start a remote debugging session and set a few breakpoint to see if we can figure out what is coursing the error, this approach means that the users on the production server cannot continue their workflow because the breakpoint stops the flow of the application, and the customer does not like that idea either. So we end up with two choices that the customer does not like.</p><p>Luckily at Microsoft Build 2017, Microsoft introduced the <strong>Visual Studio snapshot debugger</strong>. Visual Studio snapshot debugger enables us to debug the production server without affecting the users and collect error data showcasing the state of the application when the error was thrown.</p><p>In this blog post, I will introduce you to how it works, and how to setup Visual Studio snapshot debugger.</p><h2 id=introduction-to-snapshot-debugger>Introduction to snapshot debugger</h2><p>Snapshot debugger enables us to automatically collect debug snapshots from live applications. The snapshots show the state of the application and variables at the moment when the error was thrown. The error can then be viewed on Azure Portal under the &ldquo;Snapshot Debugger&rdquo; tab.</p><p>Instead of having to go to Azure Portal every time to check up on our collected snapshots. It is possible to get a better experience by downloading the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SnapshotDebuggerTeam.MicrosoftSnapshotDebugger" title="Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger extension link">Visual Studio Snapshot Debugger extension</a> for Visual Studio 2017 <strong>Enterprise</strong>. The extension enables the possibility of debugging snapshots in Visual Studio. It also enables us to set breakpoints directly in our source code and get real-time snapshots directly in Visual Studio without affecting the users on the site giving us the possibility of debugging live applications. Since I don&rsquo;t have a Visual Studio Enterprise version I won&rsquo;t be able to show you the features.</p><p>Note that if you&rsquo;re running ASP.NET Core snapshot debugger is only available for ASP.NET Core Version 2.0 and newer.</p><h2 id=setting-up-visual-studio-snapshot-debugger>Setting up Visual Studio snapshot debugger</h2><p>Collecting snapshots requires setting up Application Insights. Setting up Application Insights is very easy. All you need is a Microsoft Account with Azure and a web-application either hosted in the cloud or on an IIS.</p><p>To use Application Insights in your project, just right click your project file click &ldquo;add&rdquo; and choose &ldquo;Application Insights Telemetry&rdquo;. After that is done you will be prompted with the setup of Application Insights, just follow the wizard and you will have Application Insights up and running in no time!</p><p><img src=/blogpost/e396f2b5-6b08-47a5-a0a7-875b915e4dee.png alt="Shows how to add application insights to an asp.net project."></p><p>Next step is to include <a href=http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.SnapshotCollector>Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.SnapshotCollector</a> NuGet package in your app. This can either be done from the NuGet package manager console typing the following command.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>Install-Package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.SnapshotCollector
